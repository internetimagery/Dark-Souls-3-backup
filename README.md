# Dark Souls 3 Game Save Backup Tool

Simple backup script for *dark souls 3* game files.

Download, unzip and extract all *".bat"* files into a folder somewhere. Keep the three files together.

### Backups

To back your save up, double click the file *"backup.bat"*.

It will ask you what you have done. Write a simple comment so you know what the backup referrs to. For instance "led to Midir". This way you know how far back the backup goes.

### Restore

Similarly to restore your save, double click the file *"restore.bat"*.

You will be presented with a numbered list of the most recent backups. Type in the number of the backup you will to restore to and it will be done!

**WARNING:** Restoring your save file will overwrite the current save. If you're unsure, do a backup before doing a restore. This way you can go back to the save right before it was restored.

### Convenience

Finally the *"start.bat"* file is a convenience one. Use it!

Double click it to launch the game (you can replace your game shortcuts with this file instead) and to pop up a second window asking for backups.

This backup window is on a loop, forever asking for backups. So whenever you want to save a new backup, just *alt+TAB* to it and type something in. Hitting enter.

I hope these tools help. Have fun out there, but prepare to die!
